                    Hummingbirds are birds native to the Americas and comprise the biological family Trochilidae. With about 366 species and 113 genera,[1] they occur from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, but most species are found in Central and South America.[2] About 28 hummingbird species are listed as endangered or critically endangered, with numerous species declining in population.[2][3]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hummingbirds have numerous specialized characteristics to enable rapid, maneuverable flight, exceptional metabolic capacity, communication, and long-distance migration in some species. Among all birds, male hummingbirds have the widest diversity of plumage color, particularly in blues, greens, and purples.[4] Hummingbirds are the smallest mature birds, measuring 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) in length. The smallest is the 5 cm (2.0 in) bee hummingbird, which weighs less than 2.0 g (0.07 oz), and the largest is the 23 cm (9.1 in) giant hummingbird, weighing 18–24 grams (0.63–0.85 oz). Noted for long beaks, hummingbirds are specialized for feeding on flower nectar, but all species also consume small insects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their beating wings, which flap at high frequencies audible to other birds and humans. They hover at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around 12 beats per second in the largest species to 80 per second in small hummingbirds 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hummingbirds have the highest mass-specific metabolic rate of any homeothermic animal.[5] To conserve energy when food is scarce and at night when not foraging, they can enter torpor, a state similar to hibernation, and slow their metabolic rate to 1/15 of its normal rate.[6] While most hummingbirds do not migrate, the rufous hummingbird has one of the longest migrations among birds, traveling twice per year between Alaska and Mexico, a distance of about 3,900 miles (6,300 km).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hummingbirds split from their sister group, the swifts and treeswifts, around 42 million years ago. The common ancestor of extant hummingbirds is estimated to have lived 22 million years ago in South America.

                    Hummingbirds are small birds (weighing 2–20 grams (0.071–0.705 oz)) with long, narrow bills.[7][8] The iridescent colors and highly specialized feathers of many species (mainly in males) give some hummingbirds exotic common names, such as sun gem, fairy, woodstar, sapphire or sylph.[8] 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hummingbirds have a limited distribution in the New World, with more than 300 species in Central and South America, and only about 15 native species, along with 9 vagrant species, in the United States and Canada.[2] The northernmost hummingbird is the rufous (Selasphorus rufus), which breeds as far north as coastal Alaska and throughout British Columbia, while the ruby-throated hummingbird breeds in eastern Canada and eastern United States, migrating to spend winter in the Caribbean region, eastern Mexico, and Central American countries.[2][7][8] A total population estimate for the ruby-throated hummingbird is 34 million birds, making it the most populous among hummingbirds in the United States and Canada, while some species are endangered and in decline, with only a few hundred remaining.[2]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hummingbirds have compact bodies with relatively long, bladelike wings having anatomical structure enabling helicopter-like flight in any direction, including the ability to hover.[7][8] Particularly while hovering, the wing beats produce the humming sounds, which also may function to alert other birds.[8] In some species, the tail feathers produce sounds used by males during courtship flying.[7][8] Hummingbirds have extremely rapid wing-beats as high as 80 per second, supported by a high metabolic rate dependent on foraging for sugars from flower nectar.[7] Hummingbirds have low-volume songs that resemble scratches or squeaks.[7][8] Of those species that have been measured during flying in wind tunnels, the top flight speeds of hummingbird exceed 15 m/s (54 km/h; 34 mph). During courtship, some male species dive from 30 metres (100 ft) of height above a female at speeds around 23 m/s (83 km/h; 51 mph).[9][10]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sexes are different in feather coloration, with males having distinct brilliance and ornamentation of head, neck, wing, and breast feathers.[7][8] The most typical feather ornament in males is the gorget – a bib-like iridescent neck-feather patch that changes brilliance with the viewing angle to attract females and warn male competitors for territory.[8]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hummingbird females build a nest as a small cup using spider webs, lichens, moss, and loose strings of plant fibers commonly attached to a tree branch.[7][8] Typically, two pea-shaped white eggs – the smallest of any bird – are incubated over 2-3 weeks in late spring.[7][8] Fed by regurgitation only from the mother, the chicks fledge in about 3 weeks.[7]

                <p>
                    Some species of sunbirds – an Old World species restricted in distribution to Eurasia, Africa, and Australia – resemble hummingbirds in appearance and behavior,[11] but are not related to hummingbirds, as their resemblance is due to convergent evolution.[12]

                <p>
                    The hummingbird moth has flying and feeding characteristics similar to those of a hummingbird.[13] Hummingbirds may be mistaken for hummingbird hawk-moths, which are large, flying insects with hovering capabilities, and exist only in Eurasia.[11]

                    Hummingbirds are restricted to the Americas from south central Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, including the Caribbean. The majority of species occur in tropical and subtropical Central and South America, but several species also breed in temperate climates and some hillstars occur even in alpine Andean highlands at altitudes up to 5,200 m (17,100 ft).[14]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The greatest species richness is in humid tropical and subtropical forests of the northern Andes and adjacent foothills, but the number of species found in the Atlantic Forest, Central America or southern Mexico also far exceeds the number found in southern South America, the Caribbean islands, the United States, and Canada. While fewer than 25 different species of hummingbirds have been recorded from the United States and fewer than 10 from Canada and Chile each,[15] Colombia alone has more than 160[16] and the comparably small Ecuador has about 130 species.[17]

                    The migratory ruby-throated hummingbird breeds in a range from the Southeastern United States to Ontario,[18] while the black-chinned hummingbird, its close relative and another migrant, is the most widespread and common species in the southwestern United States. The rufous hummingbird is the most widespread species in western North America,[19] and the only hummingbird to be recorded outside of the Americas, having occurred in the Chukchi Peninsula of Russia.[20]

                    The family Trochilidae was introduced in 1825 by Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors with Trochilus as the type genus.[21][22] In traditional taxonomy, hummingbirds are placed in the order Apodiformes, which also contains the swifts, but some taxonomists have separated them into their own order, the Trochiliformes. Hummingbirds' wing bones are hollow and fragile, making fossilization difficult and leaving their evolutionary history poorly documented. Though scientists theorize that hummingbirds originated in South America, where species diversity is greatest, possible ancestors of extant hummingbirds may have lived in parts of Europe and what is southern Russia today.[23]

                <p>
                    Around 366 hummingbirds have been identified. They have been traditionally divided into two subfamilies: the hermits (subfamily Phaethornithinae) and the typical hummingbirds (subfamily Trochilinae, all the others). Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown, though, that the hermits are sister to the topazes, making the former definition of the Trochilinae not monophyletic. The hummingbirds form nine major clades: the topazes and jacobins, the hermits, the mangoes, the coquettes, the brilliants, the giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), the mountaingems, the bees, and the emeralds.[24] The topazes and jacobins combined have the oldest split with the rest of the hummingbirds. The hummingbird family has the third-greatest number of species of any bird family (after the tyrant flycatchers and the tanagers).[24][25]
                </p>

                    Fossil hummingbirds are known from the Pleistocene of Brazil and the Bahamas, but neither has yet been scientifically described, and fossils and subfossils of a few extant species are known. Until recently, older fossils had not been securely identifiable as those of hummingbirds.

                    In 2004, Gerald Mayr identified two 30-million-year-old hummingbird fossils. The fossils of this primitive hummingbird species, named Eurotrochilus inexpectatus ("unexpected European hummingbird"), had been sitting in a museum drawer in Stuttgart; they had been unearthed in a clay pit at Wiesloch–Frauenweiler, south of Heidelberg, Germany, and, because hummingbirds were assumed to have never occurred outside the Americas, were not recognized to be hummingbirds until Mayr took a closer look at them.[23][26] 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fossils of birds not clearly assignable to either hummingbirds or a related extinct family, the Jungornithidae, have been found at the Messel pit and in the Caucasus, dating from 35 to 40 million years ago; this indicates that the split between these two lineages indeed occurred around that time. The areas where these early fossils have been found had a climate quite similar to that of the northern Caribbean or southernmost China during that time. The biggest remaining mystery at present is what happened to hummingbirds in the roughly 25 million years between the primitive Eurotrochilus and the modern fossils. The astounding morphological adaptations, the decrease in size, and the dispersal to the Americas and extinction in Eurasia all occurred during this timespan. DNA–DNA hybridization results suggest that the main radiation of South American hummingbirds took place at least partly in the Miocene, some 12 to 13 million years ago, during the uplifting of the northern Andes.[27]

                    In 2013, a 50-million-year-old bird fossil unearthed in Wyoming was found to be a predecessor to both hummingbirds and swifts before the groups diverged.[28]

                    Hummingbirds are thought to have split from other members of Apodiformes, the insectivorous swifts (family Apodidae) and treeswifts (family Hemiprocnidae), about 42 million years ago, probably in Eurasia.[24] Despite their current New World distribution, the earliest species of hummingbird occurred in the early Oligocene (Rupelian about 34–28 million years ago) of Europe, belonging to the genus Eurotrochilus, having similar morphology to modern hummingbirds.[26][29][30]

                    <b><h3>Phylogeny</h3></b>
                    <p>
                        A phylogenetic tree unequivocally indicates that modern hummingbirds originated in South America, with the last common ancestor of all living hummingbirds living around 22 million years ago.[24]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A map of the hummingbird family tree – reconstructed from analysis of 284 species – shows rapid diversification from 22 million years ago.[31] Hummingbirds fall into nine main clades – the topazes, hermits, mangoes, brilliants, coquettes, the giant hummingbird, mountaingems, bees, and emeralds – defining their relationship to nectar-bearing flowering plants which attract hummingbirds into new geographic areas.[24][32][33] 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Molecular phylogenetic studies of the hummingbirds have shown that the family is composed of nine major clades.[32][24] When Edward Dickinson and James Van Remsen Jr. updated the Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World for the 4th edition in 2013, they divided the hummingbirds into six subfamilies.[34]

                    <p>
                        Molecular phylogenetic studies determined the relationships between the major groups of hummingbirds.[24][33] In the cladogram below, the English names are those introduced in 1997.[35] The Latin names are those introduced in 2013.[36]While all hummingbirds depend on flower nectar to fuel their high metabolisms and hovering flight, coordinated changes in flower and bill shape stimulated the formation of new species of hummingbirds and plants. Due to this exceptional evolutionary pattern, as many as 140 hummingbird species can coexist in a specific region, such as the Andes range.[31]

                    <p>
                        The hummingbird evolutionary tree shows one key evolutionary factor appears to have been an altered taste receptor that enabled hummingbirds to seek nectar.[37]

                        Upon maturity, males of a particular species, Phaethornis longirostris, the long-billed hermit, appear to be evolving a dagger-like weapon on the beak tip as a secondary sexual trait to defend mating areas.[38]

                    <b><h3>Geographic diversification</h3></b>
                    <p>
                        The Andes Mountains appear to be a particularly rich environment for hummingbird evolution because diversification occurred simultaneously with mountain uplift over the past 10 million years.[31] Hummingbirds remain in dynamic diversification inhabiting ecological regions across South America, North America, and the Caribbean, indicating an enlarging evolutionary radiation.[31]  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within the same geographic region, hummingbird clades coevolved with nectar-bearing plant clades, affecting mechanisms of pollination.[39][40] The same is true for the sword-billed hummingbird (Ensifera ensifera), one of the morphologically most extreme species, and one of its main food plant clades (Passiflora section Tacsonia).[41]

                    <b><h3>Coevolution with ornithophilous flowers</h3></b>
                    <p>
                        Hummingbirds are specialized nectarivores tied to the ornithophilous flowers upon which they feed.[42] This coevolution implies that morphological traits of hummingbirds, such as bill length, bill curvature, and body mass are correlated with morphological traits of plants, such as corolla length, curvature, and volume.[43] Some species, especially those with unusual bill shapes, such as the sword-billed hummingbird and the sicklebills, are coevolved with a small number of flower species. Even in the most specialized hummingbird–plant mutualisms, though, the number of food plant lineages of the individual hummingbird species increases with time.[44] The bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae) – the world's smallest bird – evolved to dwarfism likely because it had to compete with long-billed hummingbirds having an advantage for nectar foraging from specialized flowers, consequently leading the bee hummingbird to more successfully compete for flower foraging against insects.[45][46]  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many plants pollinated by hummingbirds produce flowers in shades of red, orange, and bright pink, though the birds take nectar from flowers of other colors as well. Hummingbirds can see wavelengths into the near-ultraviolet, but hummingbird-pollinated flowers do not reflect these wavelengths as many insect-pollinated flowers do. This narrow color spectrum may render hummingbird-pollinated flowers relatively inconspicuous to most insects, thereby reducing nectar robbing.[47][48] Hummingbird-pollinated flowers also produce relatively weak nectar (averaging 25% sugars w/w) containing a high proportion of sucrose, whereas insect-pollinated flowers typically produce more concentrated nectars dominated by fructose and glucose.[49]  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hummingbirds and the plants they visit for nectar have a tight coevolutionary association, generally called a plant–bird mutualistic network.[50] These birds show high specialization and modularity, especially in communities with high species richness. These associations are also observed when closely related hummingbirds, for example two species of the same genus, visit distinct sets of flowering species.[50][51]

                <p>
                    Hummingbirds exhibit sexual size dimorphism according to Rensch's rule,[52] in which males are smaller than females in small-bodied species, and males are larger than females in large-bodied species.[53] The extent of this sexual size difference varies among clades of hummingbirds.[53][54] For example, the Mellisugini clade (bees) exhibits a large size dimorphism, with females being larger than males.[54] Conversely, the Lesbiini clade (coquettes) displays very little size dimorphism; males and females are similar in size.[54] Sexual dimorphisms in bill size and shape are also present between male and female hummingbirds,[54] where in many clades, females have longer, more curved bills favored for accessing nectar from tall flowers.[55] For males and females of the same size, females tend to have larger bills.[54]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sexual size and bill differences likely evolved due to constraints imposed by courtship, because mating displays of male hummingbirds require complex aerial maneuvers.[52] Males tend to be smaller than females, allowing conservation of energy to forage competitively and participate more frequently in courtship.[52] Thus, sexual selection favors smaller male hummingbirds.[52]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Female hummingbirds tend to be larger, requiring more energy, with longer beaks that allow for more effective reach into crevices of tall flowers for nectar.[55] Thus, females are better at foraging, acquiring flower nectar, and supporting the energy demands of their larger body size.[55] Directional selection thus favors the larger hummingbirds in terms of acquiring food.[53]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another evolutionary cause of this sexual bill dimorphism is that the selective forces from competition for nectar between the sexes of each species drives sexual dimorphism.[54] Depending on which sex holds territory in the species, the other sex having a longer bill and being able to feed on a wide variety of flowers is advantageous, decreasing intraspecific competition.[55] For example, in species of hummingbirds where males have longer bills, males do not hold a specific territory and have a lek mating system.[55] In species where males have shorter bills than females, males defend their resources, so females benefit from a longer bill to feed from a broader range of flowers.[55]

                        The hummingbird plumage coloration gamut, particularly for blue, green, and purple colors in the gorget and crown of males, occupies 34% of the total color space for bird feathers.[4] White (unpigmented) feathers have the lowest incidence in the hummingbird color gamut.[4] Hummingbird plumage color diversity evolved from sexual and social selection on plumage coloration, which correlates with the rate of hummingbird species development over millions of years.[4] Bright plumage colors in males are part of aggressive competition for flower resources and mating.[4][56] The bright colors result both from pigmentation in the feathers and from prismal cells within the top layers of feathers of the head, gorget, breast, back and wings.[4][57] When sunlight hits these cells, it is split into wavelengths that reflect to the observer in varying degrees of intensity,[57] with the feather structure acting as a diffraction grating.[57] Iridescent hummingbird colors result from a combination of refraction and pigmentation, since the diffraction structures themselves are made of melanin, a pigment,[4][56] and may also be colored by carotenoid pigmentation and more subdued black, brown or gray colors dependent on melanin.[57]

                        One study of Anna's hummingbirds found that dietary protein was an influential factor in feather color, as birds receiving more protein grew significantly more colorful crown feathers than those fed a low-protein diet.[59] Additionally, birds on a high-protein diet grew yellower (higher hue) green tail feathers than birds on a low-protein diet.[59]
